# ascii_conversion

The script is a tool for processing text, SQL and Excel files and converting any non-ASCII characters to their ASCII equivalent. It checks if the file format is supported, reads the file, converts non-ASCII characters to their equivalent ASCII characters, and saves the file with a new name. Additionally, it logs any modifications made to the file and displays them in the console. The script can be used to ensure that text files are compatible with systems that do not support non-ASCII characters.
